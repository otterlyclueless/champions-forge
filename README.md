## What is Champions Forge?

Champions Forge helps competitive trainers **plan their squad before battle**. Every calculation uses the exact **Pokémon Champions** ruleset — Lv50 fixed, IVs maxed at 31, 66 SP total (32 per stat), with proper nature modifiers. Numbers you see in the app are the numbers you'll see in-game.

It's a Progressive Web App — installable on your phone home screen, works offline for cached content, and syncs competitive builds + team rosters to Supabase when you're online.

## 🛠 Stack

- **Frontend** — Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS PWA, **no framework, no build step**
- **Modular JS** — section files under `app/` for core shell, builds, teams, items/reference/profile, pickers, public routes, sharing, and bootstrap. See `app/README.md`.
- **Modular CSS** — section files under `styles/`, loaded directly by `index.html` in cascade order. See `styles/README.md`.
- **Housekeeping check** — run `scripts/check-paths.sh` after moving files to verify linked JS/CSS paths and JavaScript syntax.
- **Backend** — [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (PostgreSQL + Row-Level Security + Auth)
- **Auth** — email/password, instant activation (no confirmation step), refresh-token flow via `authFetch()` wrapper
- **Hosting** — GitHub Pages (auto-deploys from `main`)

## 📊 Database

17 tables in the `public` schema, all with Row-Level Security:

| Category | Tables |
|---|---|
| Core data | `pokemon` (258) · `moves` (900) · `abilities` (191) · `items` (117) · `natures` (25) · `pokemon_moves` (16,450) |

## 🚀 Running locally

No build step, no package install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/otterlyclueless/champions-forge.git
cd champions-forge

# VS Code Live Server (easiest):
#   Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"

# Or Python:
python3 -m http.server 5500
# Visit http://localhost:5500
```

To fork against your own Supabase project:

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the SQL migrations (see `sql/` directory)
3. Replace `API` + `ANON` at the top of `app/core/core.js` with your project URL + anon key
4. Import reference data via the admin panel or direct SQL

## 🗺 Roadmap

- **Desktop polish** — wider layouts, multi-column builds/teams list, improved sidebar use of space
- **Email** — Resend integration for proper transactional emails (password reset, notifications)
- **Share image edge function** — server-side Puppeteer rendering to replace client-side html-to-image
- **Build import** — paste Showdown format to auto-populate a build
- **Battle formats** — BO3 series tracking, opponent team logging
